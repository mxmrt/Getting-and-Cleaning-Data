#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains a Course Project for the [Getting & Cleaning Data course](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera. This course is the third course in the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripTop).

## Course Summary
**From Course Description:** 
>*Before you can work with data you have to get some. This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover obtaining data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from colleagues in various formats. It will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data “tidy”. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.*

## Project Information

### Project Summary
In this project, we are asked to design a script that will combine and "tidy" a compilation of raw data sets. A Code Book outlines the data and script in greater detail.

### Project Objectives
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Project Data
* Download this [zip file](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to the working directory. 
* The original description of the data can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
